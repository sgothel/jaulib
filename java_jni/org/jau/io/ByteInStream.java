 * ### ByteInStream Properties
 * The byte input stream can originate from a local source w/o delay,
 * remote URL like http connection or even from another thread feeding the input buffer.<br />
 * Both latter asynchronous resources may expose blocking properties
 * in available().
 *
 * Asynchronous resources benefit from knowing their content size,
 * as their available() implementation may avoid
 * blocking and waiting for requested bytes available
 * if the stream is already beyond its scope.
 *
 * All method implementations are of `noexcept`.
 *
 * One may use fail() to detect whether an error has occurred,
 * while end_of_data() not only covers the end-of-stream (EOS) case but includes fail().
 *
 * @see @ref byte_in_stream_properties "ByteInStream Properties"
